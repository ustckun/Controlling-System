Software for CAS Key Lab of Plasma Physics


With the increasing number of laboratory instruments and the rising of instrument manufactures, each laboratory always have a lot of experimental apparatus in different brands and models. When buying the instruments, each of them will be attached with a relevant software designed by the producers themselves. But different controlling software leads that you need to open many controlling software during one experiment. What’s more, the notes of data and parameters don’t have a standard to record which results that it is inability to find information in an easy way.
This dissertation introduces two kinds of ways, VISA serial communication and underlying programming from SDK, developing instruments’ controlling software using virtual instrument development platform, Labview, and mixed programming techniques. In the meantime, the functions of recording and searching the laboratory notes are added into this software. I designed and implemented an instruments’ controlling and notes record software which make the “one software controlling & one platform recording” come true. This software create a significantly easier experimental adjustments, notes recording and data searching.
